For this project, I've created a recipes website where I've applied the basic HTML skills I've learned from The Odin Project's Foundations Course, including but not limited to:
- Organizing text using elements for headings, paragraphs, and lists.
- Creating relative links to navigate within the website.
- Displaying images on a webpage.
